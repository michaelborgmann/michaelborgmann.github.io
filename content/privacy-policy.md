# Privacy Policy

We are very pleased about your interest. Data protection is of particularly high importance to me, Michael Borgmann. The use of my websites is generally possible without providing any personal data. However, if a data subject wishes to use special services from my website, it may be necessary to process personal data. If the processing of personal data is necessary and there is no legal basis for such processing, we generally obtain the consent of the data subject.

The processing of personal data, such as the name, address, email address, or phone number of a data subject, is always carried out in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and in accordance with the country-specific data protection regulations applicable to me,  Knopf. Through this privacy policy, I aim to inform the public about the nature, scope, and purpose of the personal data I collect, use, and process. Furthermore, this privacy policy will inform data subjects about their rights.

I, Michael Borgmann, as the data controller, have implemented numerous technical and organizational measures to ensure the most complete protection of the personal data processed through this website. Nevertheless, internet-based data transmissions may have security vulnerabilities, so absolute protection cannot be guaranteed. For this reason, it is up to each data subject to transmit personal data through alternative means, such as by telephone.

## 1. Definitions

This privacy policy is based on the terminology used by the European legislature when enacting the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Our privacy policy should be easy to read and understandable for the public as well as for our customers and business partners. To ensure this, we would like to explain the terms used in advance.

In this privacy policy, we use the following terms, among others:

### a) Personal Data

Personal data refers to all information that relates to an identified or identifiable natural person (hereinafter referred to as "data subject"). A natural person is considered identifiable if they can be identified, directly or indirectly, particularly by assignment to an identifier such as a name, identification number, location data, an online identifier, or one or more specific features that express the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural, or social identity of that natural person.

### b) Data Subject

A data subject is any identified or identifiable natural person whose personal data is processed by the controller.

### c) Processing

Processing refers to any operation or set of operations performed on personal data, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organization, structuring, storage, alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination, or any other form of provision, alignment, or combination, restriction, erasure, or destruction.

### d) Restriction of Processing

Restriction of processing means the marking of stored personal data with the aim of limiting its processing in the future.

### e) Profiling

Profiling means any form of automated processing of personal data that involves the use of personal data to evaluate certain personal aspects relating to a natural person, particularly to analyze or predict aspects concerning work performance, economic situation, health, personal preferences, interests, reliability, behavior, location, or movements of that natural person.

### f) Pseudonymization

Pseudonymization is the processing of personal data in such a way that the personal data can no longer be attributed to a specific data subject without the use of additional information, provided that such additional information is kept separately and subject to technical and organizational measures to ensure that the personal data is not attributed to an identified or identifiable natural person.

### g) Controller or Responsible Party

The controller or responsible party is the natural or legal person, authority, agency, or other body that alone or jointly with others determines the purposes and means of processing personal data. Where the purposes and means of such processing are determined by Union or Member State law, the controller or the specific criteria for its nomination may be provided for by Union or Member State law.

### h) Processor

A processor is a natural or legal person, authority, agency, or other body that processes personal data on behalf of the controller.

### i) Recipient

A recipient is a natural or legal person, authority, agency, or other body to whom personal data is disclosed, regardless of whether they are a third party. However, authorities that may receive personal data in the course of a specific inquiry under Union or Member State law are not considered recipients.

### j) Third Party

A third party is a natural or legal person, authority, agency, or other body outside the data subject, the controller, the processor, and those authorized under the direct responsibility of the controller or the processor to process the personal data.

### k) Consent

Consent is any freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous indication of the data subject's wishes by which they, by a statement or by a clear affirmative action, signify their agreement to the processing of personal data relating to them.

## 2. Name and Address of the Data Controller

The controller responsible for processing personal data under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other applicable data protection laws in the European Union is:

Michael Borgmann
Jo√£o de Gales, 9556-296 Monchique, Portugal
Tel.: +351 963288749
E-Mail: michaelborgmann@mailbox.org
Website: www.michaelborgmann.com

## 3. Collection of General Data and Information

The website of Michael Borgmann collects a range of general data and information with each visit to the website by a data subject or an automated system. This general data and information is stored in the server log files. The data that may be collected includes (1) the types and versions of the browsers used, (2) the operating system used by the accessing system, (3) the website from which an accessing system comes to our website (so-called referrer), (4) the subpages accessed on our website by an accessing system, (5) the date and time of access to the website, (6) an internet protocol address (IP address), (7) the internet service provider of the accessing system, and (8) other similar data and information used to prevent threats in case of attacks on our information technology systems.

When using this general data and information, I, Michael Borgmann, do not make any conclusions about the data subject. This information is rather needed to (1) deliver the content of our website correctly, (2) optimize the content of our website and the advertising for it, (3) ensure the long-term functionality of our information technology systems and the technology of our website, and (4) provide law enforcement authorities with the necessary information in the event of a cyberattack. This anonymously collected data and information is therefore analyzed by me, Michael Borgmann, statistically and further evaluated with the aim of improving data protection and data security in our company, ultimately ensuring an optimal level of protection for the personal data we process. The anonymous data from the server log files is stored separately from any personal data provided by a data subject.

## 4. Contact Option via the Website

The website of Michael Borgmann contains information required by legal regulations that enable quick electronic communication with our company, including a general address for electronic mail (email address). If a data subject contacts the person responsible for processing via email or a contact form, the personal data provided by the data subject is automatically stored. Such personal data provided voluntarily by a data subject to the responsible person is stored for the purpose of processing or contacting the data subject. These personal data will not be shared with third parties.

## 5. Comment Function on the Blog on the Website

I, Michael Borgmann, offer users the opportunity to leave individual comments on specific blog posts located on the website of the responsible person. A blog is a portal typically publicly accessible on a website where one or more people, called bloggers, can post articles or write down thoughts in blog posts. Blog posts can generally be commented on by third parties.

If a data subject leaves a comment on the blog posted on this website, along with the comment provided by the data subject, the time of the comment submission and the chosen username (pseudonym) will be stored and published. Additionally, the IP address assigned to the data subject by their Internet Service Provider (ISP) will be logged. The storage of the IP address is for security reasons and in case the data subject violates the rights of third parties or posts illegal content. The storage of this personal data is in the interest of the responsible person, to protect themselves in the case of legal violations. This personal data will not be shared with third parties, unless such a transfer is legally required or is necessary for the legal defense of the responsible person.

## 6. Subscription to Comments on the Blog on the Website

Comments made in the blog by Michael Borgmann can generally be subscribed to by third parties. Specifically, a commentator has the option to subscribe to the comments that follow their own comment on a specific blog post.

If a data subject chooses the option to subscribe to comments, the responsible person will send an automatic confirmation email to verify via the double opt-in procedure whether the owner of the provided email address indeed selected this option. The option to subscribe to comments can be terminated at any time.

## 7. Routine Deletion and Blocking of Personal Data

The responsible person processes and stores personal data of the data subject only for the period necessary to achieve the storage purpose or as required by European law or other legislation the responsible person is subject to.

If the storage purpose no longer applies or a legally prescribed retention period expires, the personal data is routinely blocked or deleted according to the legal requirements.

## 8. Rights of the Data Subject

### a) Right to Confirmation

If a data subject wishes to exercise this right to confirmation, they may contact an employee of the responsible person at any time.

### b) Right to Information

Every data subject whose personal data is processed has the right to obtain information from the responsible person at any time, free of charge, about the personal data stored about them and a copy of this information. Furthermore, the European legislator has granted the data subject access to the following information:

Furthermore, the data subject has the right to request the completion of incomplete personal data‚Äîalso by means of a supplementary declaration‚Äîconsidering the purposes of processing.

If a data subject wishes to exercise this right to rectification, they may contact an employee of the responsible person at any time.

### d) Right to Deletion (Right to be Forgotten)

Every data subject whose personal data is processed has the right to request the deletion of personal data concerning them by the responsible person without undue delay, provided that one of the following reasons applies and the processing is not necessary:

* The personal data were collected or otherwise processed for purposes that are no longer necessary.

* The processing is unlawful, and the data subject opposes the deletion of personal data and requests the restriction of its use instead.
* The responsible person no longer needs the personal data for the purposes of processing, but the data subject needs it to assert, exercise, or defend legal claims.
* The data subject has objected to the processing under Article 21, paragraph 1 of the GDPR, and it has not yet been determined whether the legitimate grounds of the responsible person override those of the data subject.

If any of the above-mentioned conditions apply, and a data subject wishes to request the restriction of personal data stored by Michael Borgmann, they may contact an employee of the responsible person at any time. I, Michael Borgmann, will ensure that the processing restriction is implemented.

### f) Right to Data Portability

Every data subject whose personal data is processed has the right to receive the personal data concerning them, which was provided to the responsible person, in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format. They also have the right to transmit this data to another controller without hindrance from the responsible person to whom the personal data was provided, provided that the processing is based on consent under Article 6, paragraph 1, letter a of the GDPR or Article 9, paragraph 2, letter a of the GDPR, or on a contract under Article 6, paragraph 1, letter b of the GDPR, and the processing is carried out by automated means, unless the processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the responsible person.

Furthermore, the data subject, when exercising their right to data portability under Article 20, paragraph 1 of the GDPR, has the right to request that personal data be transmitted directly from one controller to another, where technically feasible, without affecting the rights and freedoms of other persons.

To exercise the right to data portability, the data subject may contact me, Michael Borgmann, at any time.

### g) Right to Object

Every data subject whose personal data is processed has the right, granted by the European legislator, to object at any time, on grounds relating to their particular situation, to the processing of their personal data which is based on Article 6, paragraph 1, letters e or f of the GDPR. This includes profiling based on these provisions.

I, Michael Borgmann, will no longer process the personal data in the event of an objection, unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for processing that override the interests, rights, and freedoms of the data subject, or the processing is necessary for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims.

If I, Michael Borgmann, process personal data for direct marketing purposes, the data subject has the right to object at any time to the processing of personal data for such marketing purposes. This also applies to profiling to the extent that it is related to such direct marketing. If the data subject objects to the processing for direct marketing purposes, I, Michael Borgmann, will no longer process the personal data for such purposes.

The data subject also has the right, on grounds relating to their particular situation, to object to the processing of personal data by me, Michael Borgmann, for scientific or historical research purposes, or statistical purposes under Article 89, paragraph 1 of the GDPR, unless such processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest.

To exercise the right to object, the data subject may contact me, Michael Borgmann, or another employee at any time.

### h) Automated Decisions in Individual Cases, Including Profiling

Every data subject whose personal data is processed has the right to not be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, that produces legal effects concerning them or similarly significantly affects them, unless the decision (1) is necessary for the entry into or performance of a contract between the data subject and the responsible person, or (2) is authorized by Union or Member State law to which the responsible person is subject, and such law contains appropriate safeguards for the rights and freedoms, and legitimate interests of the data subject, or (3) is based on the explicit consent of the data subject.

If the decision (1) is necessary for the conclusion or performance of a contract between the data subject and the responsible person, or (2) is based on the explicit consent of the data subject, I, Michael Borgmann, will take appropriate measures to safeguard the rights and freedoms and legitimate interests of the data subject, including at least the right to obtain human intervention on the part of the responsible person, to express their point of view, and to contest the decision.

If the data subject wishes to assert rights regarding automated decisions, they may contact an employee of the responsible person at any time.

### i) Right to Withdraw Consent to Data Processing

## 9. Privacy Policy Regarding the Use and Application of Facebook

he controller responsible for processing has integrated components of the company Facebook on this website. Facebook is a social network.

A social network is an online social gathering place, a virtual community that typically allows users to communicate with each other and interact in a virtual space. A social network can serve as a platform for exchanging opinions and experiences or allow the internet community to share personal or business-related information. Facebook enables users of the social network, among other things, to create private profiles, upload photos, and connect with others through friend requests.

The operating company of Facebook is Facebook, Inc., 1 Hacker Way, Menlo Park, CA 94025, USA. The responsible party for processing personal data, if a data subject lives outside of the USA or Canada, is Facebook Ireland Ltd., 4 Grand Canal Square, Grand Canal Harbour, Dublin 2, Ireland.

By visiting any of the individual pages of this website operated by the controller, on which a Facebook component (Facebook plug-in) has been integrated, the internet browser on the affected person's IT system is automatically prompted by the respective Facebook component to download a representation of the corresponding Facebook component from Facebook. An overview of all Facebook plug-ins can be accessed at https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/?locale=en_US. As part of this technical procedure, Facebook learns which specific subpage of our website is being visited by the affected person.

If the affected person is simultaneously logged into Facebook, Facebook recognizes with each visit of our website by the affected person and during the entire duration of their stay on our website, which specific subpage of our website the affected person is visiting. This information is collected by the Facebook component and assigned to the respective Facebook account of the affected person by Facebook. If the affected person clicks on any of the Facebook buttons integrated on our website, for example the "Like" button, or leaves a comment, Facebook associates this information with the personal Facebook user account of the affected person and stores this personal data.

Facebook receives information through the Facebook component whenever the affected person has visited our website, if the affected person is logged into Facebook at the time of the visit to our website; this happens regardless of whether the affected person clicks on the Facebook component or not. If the affected person does not want such transmission of this information to Facebook, they can prevent it by logging out of their Facebook account before visiting our website.

The data policy published by Facebook, which can be accessed at https://de-de.facebook.com/about/privacy/, provides information about the collection, processing, and use of personal data by Facebook. It also explains the privacy settings Facebook offers to protect the privacy of the affected person. Additionally, different applications are available that allow the suppression of data transmission to Facebook. Such applications can be used by the affected person to prevent data transmission to Facebook.

## 10. Privacy Policy Regarding the Use and Application of Google AdSense

The data controller has integrated Google AdSense on this website. Google AdSense is an online service that enables the placement of advertisements on third-party websites. Google AdSense is based on an algorithm that selects advertisements displayed on third-party websites that are relevant to the content of the respective third-party website. Google AdSense allows interest-based targeting of the internet user, which is implemented by generating individual user profiles.

The operator of the Google AdSense component is Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin, D04 E5W5, Ireland.

The purpose of the Google AdSense component is to integrate advertisements on our website. Google AdSense places a cookie on the affected person's information technology system. The concept of cookies was already explained above. By setting the cookie, Alphabet Inc. is enabled to analyze the use of our website. Each time a page of this website, operated by the data controller and containing a Google AdSense component, is accessed, the internet browser on the affected person‚Äôs information technology system is automatically prompted by the Google AdSense component to transmit data for online advertising purposes and commission billing to Alphabet Inc. As part of this technical process, Alphabet Inc. learns about personal data such as the IP address of the affected person, which helps Alphabet Inc. track the origin of visitors and clicks, and subsequently allows commission billing.

The affected person can prevent the setting of cookies by our website, as explained above, at any time by adjusting the settings of the internet browser they use, thus permanently objecting to the setting of cookies. Such an adjustment would also prevent Alphabet Inc. from placing a cookie on the affected person's information technology system. Additionally, a cookie already set by Alphabet Inc. can be deleted at any time via the internet browser or other software programs.

Google AdSense also uses so-called tracking pixels. A tracking pixel is a miniature graphic embedded in webpages to enable log file recording and log file analysis, allowing for statistical evaluation. Using the embedded tracking pixel, Alphabet Inc. can determine whether and when a webpage was opened by an affected person and which links were clicked. Tracking pixels are used, among other things, to evaluate website visitor traffic.

Through Google AdSense, personal data and information, including the IP address, which is necessary for capturing and billing the displayed advertisements, are transmitted to Alphabet Inc. in the United States of America. This personal data is stored and processed in the United States. Alphabet Inc. may transfer this personal data collected through the technical process to third parties.

Google AdSense is explained in more detail at this link: https://www.google.de/intl/de/adsense/start/.

## 11. Privacy Policy Regarding the Use and Application of Google Analytics (with Anonymization Function)

The data controller has integrated the Google Analytics component (with anonymization function) on this website. Google Analytics is a web analytics service. Web analytics is the collection, gathering, and evaluation of data regarding the behavior of visitors to websites. A web analytics service collects data such as which website a user came from (known as the referrer), which subpages of the website were accessed, how often and for how long a subpage was viewed. Web analytics is primarily used for the optimization of a website and for cost-benefit analysis of internet advertising.

The operator of the Google Analytics component is Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin, D04 E5W5, Ireland.

The data controller uses the "_gat._anonymizeIp" feature for web analysis via Google Analytics. This feature shortens and anonymizes the IP address of the internet connection of the affected person when accessing our website from a member state of the European Union or another signatory state of the Agreement on the European Economic Area.

The purpose of the Google Analytics component is to analyze the traffic on our website. Google uses the collected data and information, among other things, to evaluate the usage of our website, to generate online reports that display activities on our websites, and to provide other services related to the use of our website.

Google Analytics sets a cookie on the affected person's information technology system. The concept of cookies has already been explained above. By setting the cookie, Google is enabled to analyze the use of our website. Each time a page of this website, operated by the data controller and containing a Google Analytics component, is accessed, the internet browser on the affected person‚Äôs information technology system is automatically prompted by the Google Analytics component to transmit data for online analysis to Google. As part of this technical process, Google gains knowledge of personal data such as the IP address of the affected person, which Google uses to track the origin of visitors and clicks and thus enables commission billing.

The cookie stores personal information such as the time of access, the location from which the access originated, and the frequency of visits to our website by the affected person. With every visit to our website, this personal data, including the IP address of the internet connection used by the affected person, is transferred to Google in the United States of America. This personal data is stored by Google in the United States. Google may share this personal data collected through the technical process with third parties.

The affected person can prevent the setting of cookies by our website, as explained above, at any time by adjusting the settings of the internet browser they use, thus permanently objecting to the setting of cookies. Such an adjustment would also prevent Google from setting a cookie on the affected person‚Äôs information technology system. In addition, a cookie already set by Google Analytics can be deleted at any time via the internet browser or other software programs.

Furthermore, the affected person has the option to object to the collection of data generated by Google Analytics that is related to the use of this website, as well as the processing of this data by Google, and to prevent such processing. To do so, the affected person must download and install a browser add-on at the link https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout. This browser add-on informs Google Analytics via JavaScript that no data and information regarding visits to websites may be transmitted to Google Analytics. The installation of the browser add-on is considered as an objection by Google. If the affected person‚Äôs information technology system is later deleted, formatted, or reinstalled, the browser add-on must be reinstalled by the affected person to deactivate Google Analytics. If the browser add-on is uninstalled or deactivated by the affected person or another person within their control, there is the possibility of reinstalling or reactivating the browser add-on.

Further information and the applicable privacy policies from Google can be accessed at https://www.google.de/intl/de/policies/privacy/ and http://www.google.com/analytics/terms/de.html. Google Analytics is explained in more detail at this link: https://www.google.com/intl/de_de/analytics/.

## 12. Privacy Policy Regarding the Use and Application of Google AdWords

The data controller has integrated Google AdWords on this website. Google AdWords is an internet advertising service that allows advertisers to display ads in Google search results as well as in the Google ad network. Google AdWords enables an advertiser to pre-define specific keywords, which causes an ad to be displayed in Google search results only when the user retrieves a search result that is relevant to the keyword. In the Google ad network, ads are distributed across relevant websites using an automatic algorithm and based on the predefined keywords.

The operator of the Google AdWords services is Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin, D04 E5W5, Ireland.

The purpose of Google AdWords is to promote our website by displaying relevant ads on third-party websites and in the search engine results of Google, as well as displaying third-party ads on our website.

If an affected person arrives at our website via a Google ad, Google places a so-called conversion cookie on the affected person's information technology system. The concept of cookies has already been explained above. A conversion cookie becomes invalid after thirty days and is not used for identifying the affected person. Through the conversion cookie, it can be tracked (if the cookie has not yet expired) whether specific subpages, such as the shopping cart of an online shop system, were visited on our website. The conversion cookie allows both us and Google to track whether an affected person, who has arrived at our website through an AdWords ad, generated a sale, i.e., completed or abandoned a purchase.

The data and information collected through the use of the conversion cookie are used by Google to create visit statistics for our website. These visit statistics are then used by us to determine the total number of users who were referred to us via AdWords ads, i.e., to evaluate the success or failure of a particular AdWords ad, and to optimize our future AdWords ads. Neither our company nor other Google AdWords advertisers receive any information from Google that could identify the affected person.

The conversion cookie stores personal information, such as the websites visited by the affected person. Therefore, with each visit to our websites, personal data, including the IP address of the internet connection used by the affected person, is transferred to Google in the United States of America. This personal data is stored by Google in the United States. Google may share this personal data collected through the technical process with third parties.

The affected person can prevent the setting of cookies by our website, as explained above, at any time by adjusting the settings of the internet browser they use, thus permanently objecting to the setting of cookies. Such an adjustment would also prevent Google from setting a conversion cookie on the affected person‚Äôs information technology system. Additionally, a cookie already set by Google AdWords can be deleted at any time via the internet browser or other software programs.

Furthermore, the affected person has the option to object to interest-based advertising by Google. To do so, the affected person must visit the link www.google.de/settings/ads from any of their internet browsers and make the desired settings.

Further information and the applicable privacy policies of Google can be accessed at https://www.google.de/intl/de/policies/privacy/.

## 13. Privacy Policy Regarding the Use and Application of Instagram

The data controller has integrated components of the Instagram service on this website. Instagram is a service that qualifies as an audiovisual platform, allowing users to share photos and videos and also to disseminate such data across other social networks.

The operator of Instagram services is Facebook Ireland Ltd., 4 Grand Canal Square, Grand Canal Harbour, Dublin 2, Ireland.

Whenever an individual accesses one of the pages on this website that is operated by the data controller and contains an Instagram component (Insta button), the internet browser on the affected person‚Äôs information technology system is automatically prompted by the respective Instagram component to download a representation of the corresponding Instagram component. As part of this technical procedure, Instagram learns which specific subpage of our website is being visited by the affected person.

If the affected person is logged into Instagram simultaneously, Instagram recognizes, with every access to our website by the affected person and for the entire duration of their stay on our website, which specific subpage the affected person is visiting. This information is collected by the Instagram component and attributed to the respective Instagram account of the affected person. If the affected person clicks on any of the Instagram buttons integrated on our website, the data and information transmitted in this way will be assigned to the personal Instagram user account of the affected person and stored and processed by Instagram.

Instagram always receives information through the Instagram component that the affected person has visited our website when the affected person is logged into Instagram at the time of accessing our website; this occurs regardless of whether the affected person clicks the Instagram component or not. If the affected person does not want such information to be transmitted to Instagram, they can prevent the transmission by logging out of their Instagram account before accessing our website.

Further information and the applicable privacy policy of Instagram can be accessed at https://help.instagram.com/155833707900388 and https://www.instagram.com/about/legal/privacy/.

## 14. Privacy Policy Regarding the Use and Application of LinkedIn

The data controller has integrated components of LinkedIn Corporation on this website. LinkedIn is an internet-based social network that enables users to connect with existing business contacts and establish new business contacts. Over 400 million registered users in more than 200 countries use LinkedIn, making it the largest platform for business contacts and one of the most visited websites in the world.

The operator of LinkedIn is LinkedIn Corporation, 2029 Stierlin Court, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA. For data protection matters outside the USA, LinkedIn Ireland, Privacy Policy Issues, Wilton Plaza, Wilton Place, Dublin 2, Ireland is responsible.

Each time a page from our website that is equipped with a LinkedIn component (LinkedIn plug-in) is accessed, the component causes the browser used by the affected person to download the corresponding display of the LinkedIn component. Further information on LinkedIn plug-ins can be found at https://developer.linkedin.com/plugins. As part of this technical process, LinkedIn learns which specific subpage of our website the affected person is visiting.

If the affected person is logged into LinkedIn simultaneously, LinkedIn recognizes, with every access to our website by the affected person and for the entire duration of their stay on our website, which specific subpage of our website the affected person is visiting. This information is collected by the LinkedIn component and attributed to the respective LinkedIn account of the affected person. If the affected person clicks on a LinkedIn button integrated on our website, LinkedIn assigns this information to the personal LinkedIn user account of the affected person and stores this personal data.

LinkedIn always receives information via the LinkedIn component that the affected person has visited our website when the affected person is logged into LinkedIn at the time of accessing our website; this happens regardless of whether the affected person clicks the LinkedIn component or not. If the affected person does not want such information to be transmitted to LinkedIn, they can prevent it by logging out of their LinkedIn account before accessing our website.

LinkedIn offers the option to unsubscribe from email messages, SMS messages, and targeted ads as well as manage ad settings at https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/guest-controls. LinkedIn also uses partners like Quantcast, Google Analytics, BlueKai, DoubleClick, Nielsen, Comscore, Eloqua, and Lotame, which can set cookies. These cookies can be rejected at https://www.linkedin.com/legal/cookie-policy. The applicable privacy policy of LinkedIn can be accessed at https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy. The cookie policy of LinkedIn is available at https://www.linkedin.com/legal/cookie-policy.

## 19. Legal Basis for Processing

Art. 6 I lit. a GDPR serves as the legal basis for processing operations where we obtain consent for a specific processing purpose. If the processing of personal data is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the affected person is a party, such as in processing operations required for the delivery of goods or the provision of another service or consideration, the processing is based on Art. 6 I lit. b GDPR. The same applies to processing operations that are necessary to carry out pre-contractual measures, such as in cases of inquiries about our products or services. If our company is subject to a legal obligation that requires the processing of personal data, such as for fulfilling tax obligations, the processing is based on Art. 6 I lit. c GDPR. In rare cases, the processing of personal data may be necessary to protect the vital interests of the affected person or another natural person. This would be the case, for example, if a visitor were injured on our premises and their name, age, health insurance details, or other vital information needed to be passed on to a doctor, a hospital, or other third parties. In this case, the processing would be based on Art. 6 I lit. d GDPR. Ultimately, processing operations could be based on Art. 6 I lit. f GDPR. This legal basis applies to processing operations that are not covered by any of the aforementioned legal bases if the processing is necessary for the protection of a legitimate interest of our company or a third party, provided that the interests, fundamental rights, and freedoms of the affected person do not override those interests. Such processing operations are permitted to us, particularly because they were explicitly mentioned by the European legislator. In this context, the legislator considered that a legitimate interest might be assumed if the affected person is a customer of the controller (Recital 47, sentence 2 GDPR).

## 20. Legitimate Interests in Processing Pursued by the Controller or a Third Party

If the processing of personal data is based on Article 6 I lit. f GDPR, our legitimate interest is the operation of our business for the benefit of the well-being of all our employees and stakeholders.

## 21. Duration for Which Personal Data Is Stored

The criterion for the duration of storage of personal data is the respective statutory retention period. After the retention period expires, the relevant data will be routinely deleted, provided that they are no longer required for the performance of a contract or pre-contractual measures.

## 22. Legal or Contractual Requirements for the Provision of Personal Data; Necessity for Contract Conclusion; Obligation of the Affected Person to Provide Personal Data; Possible Consequences of Non-Provision

We inform you that the provision of personal data is partly required by law (e.g., tax regulations) or may result from contractual provisions (e.g., information about the contracting party). In some cases, the conclusion of a contract may require the affected person to provide us with personal data that must be processed by us. The affected person is, for example, obliged to provide us with personal data if our company enters into a contract with them. Failure to provide the personal data would result in the contract not being concluded with the affected person. Before providing personal data, the affected person must contact one of our employees. Our employee will inform the affected person on a case-by-case basis whether the provision of personal data is required by law or contract or necessary for the conclusion of the contract, whether there is an obligation to provide personal data, and what the consequences would be if the personal data is not provided.

## 23. Existence of Automated Decision-Making

As a responsible company, we refrain from automated decision-making or profiling.
