I am a technology enthusiast, and always want to know how things work. As a {{< text-color color="blue" string="programmer" >}}, I live this passion out and are always looking for like-minded people to face challenges, tackle problems, and make this world a little better.

I'm a an all-round {{< text-color color="blue" string="coder" >}} by heart, turning my passion into a job. I consider myself as {{< text-color color="blue" string="fullstack app'n'web developer" >}} with decent {{< text-color color="blue" string="design" >}} and {{< text-color color="blue" string="online marketing" >}} skills. Currently, I specialize on {{< text-color color="blue" string="Apple platforms" >}} with a strong focus on {{< text-color color="blue" string="iOS" >}} coding in {{< text-color color="blue" string="Swift" >}}. Mobility is a lifestyle to me, and {{< text-color color="blue" string="mobile technologies" >}} offer powerful tools to simplify this way of living. I take thinking outside the box for granted, and therefore follow other technologies and trends as well. I power {{< text-color color="blue" string="mobile apps" >}} with custom {{< text-color color="blue" string="web solutions" >}} using the {{< text-color color="blue" string="MEAN" >}} stack.
