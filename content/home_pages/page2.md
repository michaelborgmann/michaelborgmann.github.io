I am a technology enthusiast, always eager to understand how things work. As a {{< colorize "developer" "blue" >}}, I live this passion every day, constantly seeking like-minded people to face challenges, solve problems, and make the world a little better.

I'm an all-round {{< colorize "coder" "blue" >}} at heart, turning my passion into my profession. I consider myself a {{< colorize "full-stack app and web developer" "blue" >}}, with solid {{< colorize "design" "blue" >}} and {{< colorize "online marketing" "blue" >}} skills.

Currently, I specialize in {{< colorize "Apple platforms" "blue" >}}, focusing on {{< colorize "iOS" "blue" >}} development using {{< colorize "Swift" "blue" >}} and {{< colorize "SwiftUI" "blue" >}}. Mobility is a lifestyle for me, and {{< colorize "mobile technologies" "blue" >}} provide powerful tools to simplify this way of living. Thinking outside the box comes naturally, which is why I also follow other emerging technologies and trends. I power {{< colorize "mobile apps" "blue" >}} with custom {{< colorize "web solutions" "blue" >}} using {{< colorize "modern JavaScript" "blue" >}} stacks."
