- responsive website = adaptive layout
- viewport = browser's viewable area

<!--more-->

Write styles for smallest screen, then provide override styles in *media queries* triggered on *viewport* threshold.

Front-end developers need to focus on the *layout viewport* (*actual viewport*). The layout viewport tells the browser, "pretend that I'm 980px wide and then draw the page".

Users are concerned with a mobile browser's *visual viewport* - the thing to pinch to zoom in and out on a page.
